üìÑ Description - Exercise Statement
This project implements a system for managing a sports newsroom, where news articles are categorized by sports such as football, basketball, tennis, Formula 1, and motorcycling. The project demonstrates the management of reporters, news articles, and their specific attributes, as well as calculates news scores and prices based on predefined criteria.

Objectives:
1. **Reporters**:
   - Each reporter has a `name`, `DNI`, and `salary`.
   - The `DNI` is immutable (cannot be changed once assigned).
   - All reporters share the same salary, which is currently set at 1500‚Ç¨ but can be updated for everyone in the future.

2. **News Articles**:
   - Each article has a `holder`, an empty `text` by default, a `score`, and a `price`.
   - Additional attributes are specific to the type of sport:
     - **Football**: Competition (`String`), club (`String`), and player (`String`).
     - **Basketball**: Competition (`String`) and club (`String`).
     - **Tennis**: Competition (`String`) and players (`String`).
     - **Formula 1**: Team (`String`).
     - **Motorcycling**: Team (`String`).

3. **Price Calculation**:
   Implement the `calculatePrice()` method to determine the price of each news article based on the following criteria:
   - **Football**:
     - Base price: 300‚Ç¨
     - Champions League: +100‚Ç¨
     - Bar√ßa or Madrid: +100‚Ç¨
     - Ferran Torres or Benzema: +50‚Ç¨
   - **Basketball**:
     - Base price: 250‚Ç¨
     - Euroleague: +75‚Ç¨
     - Bar√ßa or Madrid: +75‚Ç¨
   - **Tennis**:
     - Base price: 150‚Ç¨
     - Federer, Nadal, or Djokovic: +100‚Ç¨
   - **Formula 1**:
     - Base price: 100‚Ç¨
     - Ferrari or Mercedes: +50‚Ç¨
   - **Motorcycling**:
     - Base price: 100‚Ç¨
     - Honda or Yamaha: +50‚Ç¨

4. **Score Calculation**:
   Implement the `calculatePunctuation()` method to determine the score of each news article:
   - **Football**:
     - Base score: 5 points
     - Champions League: +3 points
     - League: +2 points
     - Bar√ßa or Madrid: +1 point
     - Ferran Torres or Benzema: +1 point
   - **Basketball**:
     - Base score: 4 points
     - Euroleague: +3 points
     - ACB: +2 points
     - Bar√ßa or Madrid: +1 point
   - **Tennis**:
     - Base score: 4 points
     - Federer, Nadal, or Djokovic: +3 points
   - **Formula 1**:
     - Base score: 4 points
     - Ferrari or Mercedes: +2 points
   - **Motorcycling**:
     - Base score: 3 points
     - Honda or Yamaha: +3 points
